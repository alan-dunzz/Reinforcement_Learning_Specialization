# Reinforcement Learning Specialization projects

This repository contains selected projects done during The University of Alberta's Reinforcement Learning Specialization projects

## Optimal Policies with Dynamic Programming
In this project, I implement the following topics in a gridworld environment:
- Policy Evaluation and Policy Improvement.
- Value and Policy Iteration.
- Bellman Equations.

## Dyna-Q and Dyna-Q+
In this project, I implement the Dyna-Q and Dyna-Q+ algorithms and compare their performance on the Shortcut Maze environment, which changes to make the task easier after X timesteps.

## Q-Learning and Expected Sarsa.
In this project, I implement Q-Learning with $\epsilon$-greedy action selection and Expected Sarsa with $\epsilon$-greedy action selection and compare their performance on the Cliff World environment

## TD with State Aggregation
In this project, I implement semi-gradient TD(0) with State Agregation on a 500-State RandomWalk Environment.
